# Digital_Image_Processing
All the image processing algorithms are implemented from scratch. 

Image processing GUI:
A simple graphic user interface (GUI) has been developed that can load an image,
apply artistic effects, display the input/output images and save the output image. The objective
of this project is to identify, formulate and solve image processing problems, and perform a
demonstration on that.The algorithms that are implemented in the project: 
1. Canny Edge Detection 
2. Face and Eye Detection Algorithm
3. Cartoon Effect 
4. Histogram Matching 
5. Image Segmentation 
6. Black and White Effect 
7. Pencil Sketch Effect 
8. Oil Painting Effect
9. Histogram Equalization
